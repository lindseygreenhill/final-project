# reading in data from the Counter Trafficking Data Collective with 62 different
# variables. Data set made in 2017. Includes 47,000 different victims of 43
# different nationalities, with exploitation taking place across 52 different
# countries. Original data class included 80,000 observations, but after
# k-anonymization widdled down. Data set compiled through analysis of different
# data models from different contributors. Polaris and IOM cofounders of this
# project. Data set not random, not necessarily representative sample of all
# human trafficking victims. Data from Liberty Asia also included. Years frange
# from 2002 to 2017. want to keep yearOfRegistration, datasource,
# gender,majorityStatus, majorityStatusAtExploit (-99 is NA), citizenship (need
# to link with values based on iso country codes), all variables starting with
# "is", include all "typeOfLabour" variables. Might not do all of these
